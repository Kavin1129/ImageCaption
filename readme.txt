## Image Caption Generation
Overview
This project involves generating captions for images using a machine learning model. The model is designed to provide descriptive text for images, but please note that it is not perfect due to limitations in computational power.

Model
The model used for generating captions is approximately 500 MB in size. You can download the saved model using the following link:

Installation
Prerequisites
Ensure you have a Python environment set up. The requirements.txt file contains the necessary libraries. Please note that this file includes libraries from a previous project and might not be fully optimized for this project. If you encounter any issues with library versions or dependencies, you may need to manually adjust them.

Setup
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Kavin1129/ImageCaption.git

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the saved model and place it in the appropriate directory as indicated in the project documentation.

Usage
Instructions for using the model to generate captions will depend on the implementation details of your project. Typically, you would load the model and pass an image to it to receive a caption.

After downloading all the necessary libraries and model, run the following command:

uvicorn app:app --reload
